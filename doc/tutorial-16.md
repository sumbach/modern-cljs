In the [previous tutorial][1] we introduced the `clojure.test` lib to
automate testing the `modern-cljs.shopping.validators`
namespace. For now, that namespace lives only on the server-side of the
`modern-cljs` web app, but we have already arranged it to be able to
run on the client-side too.

## Introduction

In this tutorial of the series we are going to make the complementary
`modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test` namespace portable to
the client side of the web app.

> NOTE 1: this namespace contains tests of the
> `modern-cljs.shopping.validators` namespace.

## Repeating the DRY principle

We've insisted so many times on adhering to the DRY principle, that I'm
pretty sure you remember we used the [portable version of Valip][2]
for validation, because it allows us to share the same validation code
on both sides of a web app.

But what about the unit testing? The server-side test namespace
(i.e., `modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test`) requires the
`clojure.test` lib, which depends on the JVM, and cannot run on the
client-side.

As usual, if you search [Chas Emerick's GitHub repositories][23]
you get a concrete answer to almost everything regarding CLJ/CLJS. He
recently wrote the [clojurescript.test][4] testing lib with the goal
of being a maximal port of `clojure.test` to CLJS.

The motivation given in the [README][5] is the
same we articulated for our `modern-cljs.shopping.validators`
namespace:

> I want to be able to write portable tests to go along with my
> portable Clojure[Script], and clojure.test's model is Good Enough
> (it's better than that, actually). Combine with something like cljx
> or lein-cljsbuild's crossovers to make your ClojureScripting a whole
> lot more pleasant.

## Preparing to dance on the border again

> NOTE 2: I suggest you to keep track of your work by issuing the
> following commands at the terminal:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/magomimmo/modern-cljs.git
> cd modern-cljs
> git checkout tutorial-15
> git checkout -b tutorial-16-step-1
> ```

The first step, as usual, is to add the `clojurescript.test` lib to the
`:plugins` section of `project.clj`.

```clj
(defproject modern-cljs "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
  ....
  :plugins [,,,
            [com.cemerick/clojurescript.test "0.2.1"]]
  ...
  ...
  )
```

Chas Emerick even [explained][6] how to use `clojurescript.test`
with the `lein-cljsbuild` plugin. So, it seems we're in a good
position to proceed to satisfy my obsession with the DRY
principle.

### Installing PhantomJS

If you want to test any CLJS code, sooner or later you will end up
the emitted JS in a headless browser. The most famous of them
all is [PhantomJS][7] which is based on [WebKit][8].

To install PhantomJS follow the [instructions][9] for your Operating
System. On any *nix OS it should be enough to download the compressed
file, decompress it and add its `bin` directory to the `PATH` environment
variable.

### Interfacing lein-cljsbuild with PhantomJS

We now need to interface the `lein-cljsbuild` plugin with the PhantomJS
headless browser binary command. To make PhantomJS launchable from
`lein-cljsbuild`, we have to exploit the `lein-cljsbuild` built-in
support for running external CLJS tests.

As usual, [Chas Emerick][3] has already interfaced PhantomJS for us by
creating a JS script which is packaged with
[clojurescript.test][4].

> NOTE 3: I have the habit to [fork][11] any repository I use and I
> suggest that you do the same. Sooner or later you can even offer
> help in fixing bugs, correcting the spelling/grammar or other minutiae
> by using GitHub [pull requests][24].

### Instructing lein-cljsbuild about PhantomJS

To instruct `lein-cljsbuild` to launch PhantomJS for testing purposes we
need to add the built-in `:test-commands` subtask in the `:cljsbuild`
section of the `project.clj` file as follows:

```clj
(defproject modern-cljs "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
  ...
  :cljsbuild {...
              ...
              :test-commands {"phantomjs-whitespace"
                              ["phantomjs" :runner "test/js/testable_dbg.js"]

                              "phantomjs-simple"
                              ["phantomjs" :runner "test/js/testable_pre.js"]

                              "phantomjs-advanced"
                              ["phantomjs" :runner "test/js/testable.js"]}
              ...
              ...
  )
```

The value of `:test-commands` is a map in which each key is a name
(e.g., `"phantomjs-whitespace"`), and each value is a vector of three
elements: the name of the `phantomjs` command, the `:runner` keyword
and the pathname of the JS file to be loaded in the headless browser
(e.g., `"test/js/testable_dbg.js"`).

In the `modern-cljs` project we already defined three CLJS `:builds`,
one for each GCLS compiler optimization level
(i.e., `whitespace`, `simple` and `advanced`).

Each build emits a corresponding JS file (i.e., `modern_dbg.js`,
`modern_pre.js` and `modern.js`). So, we need to end up with three
test commands to be inserted in the map, one for each emitted JS file.

But we don't want to emit unit test JS code to the
CLJS builds above. We just want to be able to run our unit tests without
interfering with the above builds that have already been linked in the
HTML pages.

For this reason we need to create three new CLJS `:builds`, one for
each Google Closure Compiler optimization level.

### Instructing lein-cljsbuild about CLJS test directory

In the `:builds` section of the `:cljsbuild` task you can verify that
the emitted `modern_dbg.js` and `modern_pre.js` JS files are generated
by looking for CLJS code saved in the `src/cljs` and
`src/brepl` directories. The `modern.js` JS file, instead, is emitted
by considering CLJS files from the `src/cljs` directory only.

In the [previous tutorial][1] we already arranged the `test` directory
to host the `cljs` unit test code by creating the `test/cljs`
directory.

We now have to add this directory to the `:source-paths` option in all
the three new CLJS builds we're going to configure for emitting our
testing code.

Here is the code snippet you have to add to your `profile.clj` file,
both to the `:builds` section of the `:cljsbuild` option
configuration and to the Leiningen `:test-paths` (cf. ATTENTION NOTE
in [Tutorial 1 - The Basics][22]).

```clj
(defproject modern-cljs "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
  :test-paths ["test/clj" "test/cljs"]
  :cljsbuild {...
              :builds
              {:ws-unit-tests
               {;; CLJS source code and unit test paths
                :source-paths ["src/brepl" "src/cljs" "test/cljs"]

                ;; Google Closure Compiler options
                :compiler {;; the name of emitted JS script file for unit testing
                           :output-to "test/js/testable_dbg.js"

                           ;; minimum optimization
                           :optimizations :whitespace
                           ;; prettyfying emitted JS
                           :pretty-print true}}

               :simple-unit-tests
               {;; same path as above
                :source-paths ["src/brepl" "src/cljs" "test/cljs"]

                :compiler {;; different JS output name for unit testing
                           :output-to "test/js/testable_pre.js"

                           ;; simple optimization
                           :optimizations :simple

                           ;; no need prettification
                           :pretty-print false}}

               :advanced-unit-tests
               {;; same path as above
                :source-paths ["src/cljs" "test/cljs"]

                :compiler {;; different JS output name for unit testing
                           :output-to "test/js/testable.js"

                           ;; advanced optimization
                           :optimizations :advanced

                           ;; no need prettification
                           :pretty-print false}}
  )
```

This way, the CLJS/GCLS compilers will include any CLJS test file
living in the `test/cljs` directory in the emitted JS file for each
unit test build.

### The expression problem, again

Our first instinct now would be to apply our beloved DRY principle by
just adding the `modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test` namespace to
the `:crossovers` section of the `:cljsbuild` project task, as we
already did for the portable validators we defined in the project.

Unfortunately there is an issue. The fact that `clojurescript.test`
is a maximal *port* of the `clojure.test` lib on CLJS does not
mean that *it is a portable lib*.

Take a look at the namespace declaration of the `clojurescript.test` [usage sample][12]:

```cljs
(ns cemerick.cljs.test.example
  (:require-macros [cemerick.cljs.test :refer (is deftest with-test run-tests testing)])
  (:require [cemerick.cljs.test :as t]))
```

And compare it with the corresponding declaration of the
`modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test` namespace

```clj
(ns modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer [deftest are testing]]
            [modern-cljs.shopping.validators :refer [validate-shopping-form]]))
```

The `:require-macros` keyword is one of the most annoying
[differences between CLJ and CLJS][13].

Because of those requirement differences, the simple addition of the
`modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test` namespace to the `:crossovers`
section of the project is not sufficient to resolve
duplication of the unit testing code.

### Forgetting the DRY principle for a moment

Let's ignore the DRY principle for the moment, and manually do what the
`lein-cljsbuild` `:crossovers` would have done for us if the
`clojurescript.test` was a portable CLJS/CLJ lib instead of a lib ported
from CLJ to CLJS.

Copy `validators_test.clj` from the
`test/clj/modern_cljs/shopping` directory to the corresponding
`test/cljs/modern_cljs/shopping` directory and change its extension from
`.clj` to `.cljs`.

```bash
cp -R test/clj/modern_cljs/shopping test/cljs/modern_cljs/
mv test/cljs/modern_cljs/shopping/validators_test.clj test/cljs/modern_cljs/shopping/validators_test.cljs
```

You'll end up with the following file structure:

```bash
tree test
test
├── clj
│   └── modern_cljs
│       └── shopping
│           └── validators_test.clj
└── cljs
    └── modern_cljs
        └── shopping
            └── validators_test.cljs

6 directories, 2 files
```

Now open the newly-copied `validators_test.cljs` file and modify its
namespace declaration by requiring the ported `clojurescript.test` lib
instead of the original `clojure.test` lib.

```clj
(ns modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test
  (:require-macros [cemerick.cljs.test :refer (deftest are testing)])
  (:require [cemerick.cljs.test :as t]
            [modern-cljs.shopping.validators :refer [validate-shopping-form]]))
```

### Dancing alone on the client-side of the browser

Now cross your fingers and run the following command at the terminal:

```bash
lein cljsbuild test

```

Yes, it worked. The `lein cljsbuild test` command compiled all the
three new builds, including the unit tests
defined in the `test/cljs` directory each emitted JS file,
then it sequentially executed
the `phantomjs-whitespace`, `phantomjs-simple` and
`phantomjs-advanced` commands we defined in the `:test-commands`
section of the `:cljsbuild` task. So far so good.

> NOTE 4: If you want to run the tests just for one build, do as follows:
>
> ```bash
> lein cljsbuild test phantomjs-whitespace

>
> Ran 1 tests containing 13 assertions.
> 0 failures, 0 errors.
> {:fail 0, :pass 13, :test 1, :type :summary, :error 0}
> ```

Now let's see if the the CLJ version of the tests are still working
after these changes.

```bash
lein test

lein test modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test

Ran 1 tests containing 13 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

Yes, it's still working. Now force a failure for one of the assertions
in the `validators_test.cljs` file and run `lein cljsbuild
test` again to see how it reports the failure.

```clj
(deftest validate-shopping-form-test
  (testing ...
    (testing ...
      (are [... ...] (= ... ...)
           nil (validate-shopping-form "foo" "0" "0" "0") ; force a failure
           ...
           ...))))
```

```bash
lein cljsbuild test

The test now fails, as expected. Because of the code change in
`validators_test.cljs`, `lein cljsbuild test` recompiles all
the builds before launching the three `:test-commands` and it finally
reports the assertion error for each of the builds.

## Don't Repeat Yourself while crossing the border

It's now time to actually solve the expression problem that we
previously worked around by manually copying and changing the
`test/clj/modern_cljs/shopping/validators_test.clj` file into the
`test/cljs/modern_cljs/shopping/validators_test.cljs` file to test the
`modern-cljs.shopping.validators` namespace on both sides of the
border.

We have two options:

* use the `:crossovers` facility of the `lein-cljsbuild` plugin by
  adding some *Black Magic*;
* use the [cljx][16] lein plugin by [Kevin Lynagh][17].

### No Black Magic

As written by [Evan Mezeske][14] in the [lein-cljsbuild documentation][15]

> In ClojureScript, macros are still written in Clojure, and can not be
> written in the same file as actual ClojureScript code. Also, to use them
> in a ClojureScript namespace, they must be required via :require-macros
> rather than the usual :require.
>
> This makes using the crossover feature to share macros between Clojure
> and ClojureScript a bit difficult, but lein-cljsbuild has some special
> constructs to make it possible.

If you compare again the server-side version of the
`modern_cljs/shopping/validators_test.clj` file with the corresponding
client-side version, you can see that the only detectable difference is
confined to the namespace declaration and it pertains to the macro
requirements.

However, if you take a look at the documentation for the [cljx][16]
lein plugin by [Kevin Lynagh][17], you'll discover that our
scenario perfectly fits within its scope:

> Cljx is a Lein plugin that emits Clojure and ClojureScript code from a
> single metadata-annotated codebase.

My personal opinion about the `:crossovers` option of the
[lein-cljsbuild][18] and the [cljx][16] lein plugin is that the first
is more convenient when you have to deal with **portable** libs
(e.g., [valip][2]), the second is more convenient when you have to deal
with **ported** libs (e.g., [clojurescript.test][4]).

### Dancing with a chaperone while crossing the border

So, let's dance with [cljx][16]. We start using it by moving the
`modern_cljs` directory from `test/clj` to a new `test/cljx`
directory and renaming `validators_test.clj` to
`validators_test.cljx` (note the new `.cljx` file extension to denote
metadata-annotated files).

```bash
mkdir test/cljx
mv test/clj/modern_cljs test/cljx/
mv test/cljx/modern_cljs/shopping/validators_test.clj test/cljx/modern_cljs/shopping/validators_test.cljx
```

Now delete both the `test/clj` and the `test/cljs` directories
because, as we'll see in a moment, we are not going to use them
anymore.

```bash
rm -rf test/clj test/cljs
```

We then need to modify `validators_test.cljx` by annotating the
namespace declarations with the `#+clj` and the `#+cljs` feature annotations as
follows:

```clj
#+clj (ns modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test
        (:require [clojure.test :refer [deftest are testing]]
                  [modern-cljs.shopping.validators :refer [validate-shopping-form]]))

#+cljs (ns modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test
         (:require-macros [cemerick.cljs.test :refer (deftest are testing)])
         (:require [cemerick.cljs.test :as t]
                   [modern-cljs.shopping.validators :refer [validate-shopping-form]]))
```

Finally we have to:

* add the [cljx plugin][16] to the project
* configure the `:cljx` task
* consequently update the `:test-paths` setting
* consequently update the `:source-paths` compiler option for each
  CLJS unit testing build.

Following is the relevant code snippet from `project.clj`:

```clj
(defproject modern-cljs "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  ...
  ...
  :test-paths ["target/test/clj" "target/test/cljs"] ;; See ATTENTION NOTE in tutorial-01
  ...
  ...
  :plugins [...
            ...
            [com.keminglabs/cljx "0.3.0"]] ;; cljx plugin

  ;; cljx task configuration
  :cljx {:builds [{:source-paths ["test/cljx"] ;; cljx source dir
                   :output-path "target/test/clj" ;; clj output
                   :rules :clj} ;; clj generation rules

                  {:source-paths ["test/cljx"] ;; cljx source dir
                   :output-path "target/test/cljs" ;; cljs output
                   :rules :cljs}]} ;; cljs generation rules
  ...
  ...
  :cljsbuild {...
              ...
              :builds
              {:whitespace-unit-tests
               {:source-paths [... ..."target/test/cljs"]
                ...
                ...
                }

               :simple-unit-tests
               {:source-paths [... ... "target/test/cljs"]
                ...
                ...
                }

               :advanced-unit-tests
               {:source-paths [... "target/test/cljs"]
                ...
                ...
                }}})
```

Let's review the newly updated `project.clj` file.

First, we added `[com.keminglabs/cljx "0.3.0"]` to the `:plugins`
section.

Then, in the `:cljx` task configuration we decided to save the
CLJ and CLJS code generated by `cljx` to the `target/test/clj`
and `target/test/cljs` directories, respectively.

```clj
  :cljx {:builds [{...
                   :output-path "target/test/clj" ;; clj output
                   ...}

                  {...
                   :output-path "target/test/cljs" ;; cljs output
                   ...}]}
```

The [leiningen][19] `:target-path` option defaults to the `target`
directory in the main directory of the project. By placing generated
files under `target`, the `lein clean` command will delete any files generated by `cljx`.

> NOTE 6: Many thanks to [Chas Emerick][3] for suggesting this
> smart trick.

Corresponding to the above choice, we had to modify the leiningen
`:test-paths` option with the `["target/test/clj" "target/test/cljs"]`
value so `lein test` can find the generated CLJ unit testing files, and to respect the
fact that `cljsbuild` does not add CLJS pathnames to the
Leiningen `classpath` (cf. ATTENTION NOTE in
[Tutorial 1 - The Basics][22]).

*Mutatis mutandis*, we had to update the `:source-paths` option for
each `cljsbuild` unit testing build to include the
`"target/test/cljs"` directory. As before, in this way each
`cljsbuild` unit testing build knows where to find the CLJS unit
testing files generated by `cljx`.

In the `:cljx` task configuration we defined two `cljx` generators
(i.e., `:builds`).

```clj
  :cljx {:builds [{:source-paths ["test/cljx"]
                   :output-path "target/test/clj"
                   :rules :clj}

                  {:source-paths ["test/cljx"]
                   :output-path "target/test/cljs"
                   :rules :cljs}]}
```

* The first is configured to generate the CLJ files: The `.clj` files
  will be generated into the `target/test/clj` directory starting from
  any `.cljx` file in the `test/cljx` directory by applying the
  `:clj` rule.
* The second is configured to generate the CLJS files: The `.cljs`
  files will be generated into the `target/test/cljs` directory
  starting from any `.cljx` file in the `test/cljx` directory by
  applying the `:cljs` rule.

The `:clj` and the `:cljs` keyword map to the corresponding
`clj-rules` and `cljs-rules` which have been defined by `cljx` in the
`cljx.rules` namespace and they remove from the generated code any
definition marked respectively as `#+cljs` and `#+clj`.

## Let's dance

It's now time to verify that everything is working as expected.

First, start from a clean codebase.

```bash
lein clean # do you remember the :hooks [leiningen.cljsbuild] option?
```

Next we need to generate the `.clj` and `.cljs` testing files starting
from the shared annotated `validators_test.cljx` file by specifying
the `cljx` task in the `lein` command.

```bash
lein cljx once
Rewriting test/cljx to target/test/clj (clj) with features #{clj} and 0 transformations.
Rewriting test/cljx to target/test/cljs (cljs) with features #{cljs} and 1 transformations.
```

> NOTE 7: `lein cljx` offers both `once` and `auto` subtasks (the default is
> `once`) and their behavior is the same of the corresponding `once`
> and `auto` subtask of `lein cljsbuild`. In `auto` mode, any change to a
> `.cljx` file will trigger regeneration of the `.clj` and `.cljs`
> files.

> NOTE 8: You can even automatically run `cljx` task by adding
> `cljx.hooks` to the `:hooks` option in your `project.clj` file as we
> already did for `cljsbuild`, but I experienced strange behaviour
> when configured together.

You end up with the following structure for the test files

```bash
tree target/test
target/test
├── clj
│   └── modern_cljs
│       └── shopping
│           └── validators_test.clj
└── cljs
    └── modern_cljs
        └── shopping
            └── validators_test.cljs

6 directories, 2 files
```

We can now launch the CLJS compilation with the usual command.

```bash
lein cljsbuild once
Compiling ClojureScript.
Compiling "resources/public/js/modern_pre.js" from ["src/brepl" "src/cljs"]...
Successfully compiled "resources/public/js/modern_pre.js" in 15.244085 seconds.

Compiling "test/js/testable.js" from ["src/cljs" "target/test/cljs"]...

```

### Play and Pray

Finally, cross your fingers and issue the commands to run the defined
unit tests for both the sides of the world wide web.

```bash
lein test
Compiling ClojureScript.

lein test modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test

Ran 1 tests containing 13 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
Running all ClojureScript tests.

Testing modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test

Ran 1 tests containing 13 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
{:fail 0, :pass 13, :test 1, :type :summary, :error 0}

Testing modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test

Ran 1 tests containing 13 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
{:fail 0, :pass 13, :test 1, :type :summary, :error 0}

Testing modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test

Ran 1 tests containing 13 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
{:fail 0, :pass 13, :test 1, :type :summary, :error 0}
```

We have reached our goal and we couldn't be happier! We now have a
portable namespace (i.e., `modern-cljs.shopping.validators`) for the
`shoppingForm` validators and a corresponding portable namespace
(i.e., `modern-cljs.shopping.validators-test`) which tests it on both
the client and the server side of `modern-cljs` web app.

## Final note

If you decided to follow the suggestion in NOTE 2, you can now commit
your work with the following `git` commands;

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "step-2 done"
```

Stay tuned for the next tutorial.

# Next Step - [Tutorial 17: REPLing with Enlive][21]

In the [next tutorial][21] we're going to integrate the validators for
the Shopping Calculator into the corresponding WUI (Web User
Interface) in such a way that the user will be notified with the right
error messages when she/he enters invalid values in the form.
